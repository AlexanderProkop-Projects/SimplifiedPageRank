COP3530 Data Structures and Algorithms Project 2: Simplified PageRank

When run, the program will ask for two inputs:
  The first is an integer of edges the graph will have.
  The second is an integer of power iterations the pagerank algorithm will go through.

After getting these inputs, the user will enter two vertices in the form of strings:
  The first string is the vertex the edge starts at.
  The second string is the vertex the edge ends at.
This loops equal to the number of edges the graph has

After all data has been entered, the pagerank will be calculated and displaed automatically.
